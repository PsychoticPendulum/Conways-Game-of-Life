## Conway's Game of Life by PsychoticPendulum

This is a version of the famous Game of Life invented by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

It follows 4 simple rules:
1. If a cell has less than 2 neighbours it dies
2. If a cell has 2 or 3 neighbours it survives
3. If a cell has exactly 3 neighbours it comes to life
4. If a cell has more than 3 neighbours it dies

I challenged myself to write this in Python using the PyGame Module for rendering

# Keyboard Shortcuts
1. space      -     pause
2. lmouse     -     active cell
3. rmouse     -     deactivate cell
4. q          -     quit game
5. s          -     randomize
6. m          -     activate corners
7. r          -     activate bottom half
8. c          -     clear
9. i          -     infinity mode

Feel free to use the code however you like.
