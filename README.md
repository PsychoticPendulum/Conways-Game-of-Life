# Conway's Game of Life by PsychoticPendulum

This is a version of the famous Game of Life invented by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

It follows 4 simple rules:
1. If a cell has less than 2 neighbours it dies
2. If a cell has 2 or 3 neighbours it survives
3. If a cell has exactly 3 neighbours it comes to life
4. If a cell has more than 3 neighbours it dies

I challenged myself to write this in Python using the PyGame Module for rendering

Keys:
q       -   quit
space   -   pause
c       -   clear
lmouse  -   activate cell
rmouse  -   deactivate cell
s       -   randomize
m       -   activate all edge cells
i       -   infinity mode
r       -   activate bottom half

Feel free to use the code however you like.
