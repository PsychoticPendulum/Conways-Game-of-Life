# Conway's Game of Life by PsychoticPendulum

This is a version of the famous Game of Life invented by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

It follows 4 simple rules:
1. If a cell has less than 2 neighbours it dies
2. If a cell has 2 or 3 neighbours it survives
3. If a cell has exactly 3 neighbours it comes to life
4. If a cell has more than 3 neighbours it dies

I challenged myself to write this in Python using the PyGame Module for rendering

Here's a video of how it looks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjFmh1bjCYw

Feel free to use the code however you like.

The icon.png needs to be in a directory called assets. I have yet to figure out how to create directories on here.
